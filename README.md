Must download "NFL Play by Play 2009-2017 (v4).csv" from https://www.kaggle.com/maxhorowitz/nflplaybyplay2009to2016/data to run notebooks (file too large to upload to github repository). If notebooks are run in order, all other required csv's and models will be saved automatically.

Code for 1_Data_Prep out of date and not yet updated to run quickly.
